I am __Duc Thai__, an aspiring data specialist looking to hone my machine learning and data analytic skills.

In my previous career in as a valuations expert in investment banking I spent considerable time and effort sifting through vast volumes of transactions and financial data to perform analytics and gather insights, and have been working to use my passion for data and analytical mindset to take me to the next steps in my career.

I am utilising Github to share some of my passion projects and demonstrate some of the skills I have recently acquired.<br>
